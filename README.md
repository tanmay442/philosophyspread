## Spreading Philosophical Depth and Free Internet Ideals

### 🌟 Welcome to Philosophyspread!

This GitHub repository hosts a temporary website, a precursor to a grander vision I have for fostering philosophical inquiry and promoting the ideals of a free internet. My name is **Tanmay Goel**, and at 17 years old, I'm embarking on this journey driven by a deep passion for philosophy.

## 🤔 What is Philosophyspread?

**Philosophyspread** is more than just a website; it's a community in the making, dedicated to exploring the profound questions that shape our existence. Here, I'll be sharing my thoughts and insights on core philosophical disciplines like:

- **Ethics** 
- **Metaphysics**
- **Other topics** as the journey unfolds

True to its name, Philosophyspread also champions the spirit of a **free and open internet**. I'll be curating and sharing resources that promote accessibility and knowledge sharing, while also exploring the philosophical implications of technology and the internet, engaging in discussions on crucial topics like **privacy** and **piracy**.

## 🚀 My Journey and Vision

Currently, I'm navigating the Indian education system, which doesn't typically offer straightforward paths for a double major in **Mathematics** and **Data Science**. However, I'm determined and have found a way to pursue both these fields, which I believe will greatly complement my philosophical explorations.

I've noticed a significant void in philosophical depth within India, and my hope is that Philosophyspread can become a **beacon** for those seeking to engage with these vital ideas.
