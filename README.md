    <h1>Philosophyspread: Spreading Philosophical Depth and Free Internet Ideals</h1>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Philosophyspread</strong>! This GitHub repository hosts a temporary website, a precursor to a grander vision I have for fostering philosophical inquiry and promoting the ideals of a free internet. My name is <strong>Tanmay Goel</strong>, and at 17 years old, I'm embarking on this journey driven by a deep passion for philosophy.</p>

    <h2>What is Philosophyspread?</h2>

    <p>Philosophyspread is more than just a website; it's a community in the making, dedicated to exploring the profound questions that shape our existence. Here, I'll be sharing my thoughts and insights on core philosophical disciplines like <strong>ethics</strong> and <strong>metaphysics</strong>, alongside other topics as the journey unfolds. True to its name, Philosophyspread also champions the spirit of a free and open internet. I'll be curating and sharing resources that promote accessibility and knowledge sharing, while also exploring the philosophical implications of technology and the internet, engaging in discussions on crucial topics like <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>piracy</strong>.</p>

    <h2>My Journey and Vision</h2>

    <p>Currently, I'm navigating the Indian education system, which doesn't typically offer straightforward paths for a double major in <strong>Mathematics and Data Science</strong>. However, I'm determined and have found a way to pursue both these fields, which I believe will greatly complement my philosophical explorations.</p>

    <p>I've noticed a significant void in philosophical depth within India, and my hope is that Philosophyspread can become a beacon for those seeking to engage with these vital ideas.</p>

    <h2>Join the Philosophyspread Community!</h2>

    <p>This website is just the beginning. I invite you to <a href="#">visit Philosophyspread</a> (link to be added when live), explore the content, and become a part of this budding community. Your support and engagement mean the world as we strive to spread philosophical understanding far and wide.</p>
